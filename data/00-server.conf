# This configuration file changes NetworkManager's behavior to
# what's expected on "traditional UNIX server" type deployments.
#
# See "man NetworkManager.conf" for more information about these
# and other keys.

# NetworkManager会先读取/etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf，然后是/usr/lib/NetworkManager/conf.d/下的配置
# 最后读取/etc/NetworkManager/conf.d，后读取的文件将覆盖先读取的同名文件配置
# 在/etc/NetworkManager/conf.d目录添加该文件，用以覆盖/usr/lib/NetworkManager/conf.d下的同名文件的配置
